This project is a complete web application designed to analyze the authenticity of user-generated content, specifically hotel reviews, to detect deceptive or fabricated opinions. The core of the project involves a detection algorithm (running on the backend, like Flask) trained on a Kaggle hotel review dataset to analyze the textual patterns indicative of a fake review.
